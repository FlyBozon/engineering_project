note: scripts version for testing on kaggle, to check if everything works correctly (or at least how I expect it to work)

### deepglobe TODO: 
- chceck modify path for deepglobe dataset
- add color masks to 0-n_classes encoding
- test other nn architectures, find pretrained models on sat imagery ()

other things should work correctly
